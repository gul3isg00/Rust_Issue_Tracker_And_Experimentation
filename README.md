I want to learn Rust! At least the basics... This is how I plan on doing it.

I want to make a simple application, hopefully with a GUI not just a CLI, that allows you to:
- Log in as either a client or an admin.
- The client should be able to report issues
- The admin should be able to reply to issues, changing their status and adding comments, then resolving them if they're complete
